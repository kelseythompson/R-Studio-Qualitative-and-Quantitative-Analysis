# R Project: Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Dataset

This project demonstrates the use of R to analyze a sample dataset, focusing on both qualitative and quantitative aspects. Below is an overview of the methods and insights generated during the analysis.

---

## Qualitative Analysis

The **qualitative analysis** focused on the categorical variable `Species`. Key tasks included:
- **Classification**: Divided the data into three distinct species categories.
- **Visualization**: Created a **bar plot** to visually represent the frequency of each species type. This plot highlighted patterns and distributions, providing an intuitive understanding of the dataset's structure.

The focus was on:
- Drawing meaningful insights from categorical relationships.
- Communicating findings effectively, particularly for non-technical audiences.

## Quantitative Analysis

The **quantitative analysis** emphasized numerical metrics:
- **Variance Calculation**: Performed calculations to understand variability within the dataset.
- Explored numerical data to complement the qualitative insights.

While the qualitative analysis highlighted categorical patterns, the quantitative analysis provided statistical depth to the findings.

## Visualizations

Visuals were generated in R to enhance interpretability:
- Bar plots were tailored for non-technical audiences to ensure clarity.
- Visuals, including the bar plot, are viewable in the accompanying documentation within this repository.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Language**: R
- **Key Libraries**: `ggplot2` for visualizations and `dplyr` for data manipulation.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Intuitive visual communication.
  - Technically sound analysis for diverse audiences.

## Project Goals

- To bridge the gap between technical and non-technical audiences through effective data storytelling.
- To create an analytical pipeline that is reproducible and adaptable for similar datasets.
